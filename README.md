# Item-Shipping-Calculator
This program is designed to calculate the total cost of an item you create. You get to name the item anything you want and pick the destination to ship to, you can also price the item whatever you want it to be. This code is mostly designed to compare and contrast the different shipping costs depending on the location you choose to ship to see how expensive the item you make would become. I have added an additional destination to be shipped to Russia (or RUS for short), I made it the most expensive location out of all four of them. The reason I chose Russia as a destination is because I feel that its the biggest country to ship to and that would mean alot of customers (realistically). Since its the biggest country, I made it the most expensive in terms of the cost of shipping.
